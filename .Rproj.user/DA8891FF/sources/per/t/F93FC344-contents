## Notes post-meeting

- The interest of the audience was not really on the methodology
but on its results and applications. For instance, the relationship 
between spread-rate variations and environmental variables, or the
effect of the barrier would have been largely more appreciated than
the particular interpolation method and its properties.

- Ferran would have been keen to collaborate with the presentation
to help put it into context and application.

- Data about the status of the carcasses exist, but are held-out by
the regional government.


## Lessons to be learned

- Absolutely need to share with Astre first, in order to gather
reactions and to be able to put it on line with the audience's
expectations.
  
- No equations is not enough. Concepts like _probability density_ or
_surface_ are also hard to grasp and need to be introduced and explained
with concrete analogies.

- __Give it more time, share, test, offer contribution. Don't do it alone.__
